## Introduction
**Disclaimer**: *None of these items are for sale. This store is a mockup for portfolio purposes only. If you wish to test the functionality please use the stripe developer card 4242 4242 4242 4242.*

*All products on the site are completely custom made and designed using online tools and mockup generators. None of these items are purchasable.*

**KVRN Apparel**- is a custom apparel e-commerce platform that offers a sleek, user-friendly shopping experience for modern consumers. Built with Django, the platform showcases a variety of apparel items with a focus on unique, stylish designs that cater to a broad audience. KVRN Apparel integrates key features, including a Wishlist, product filtering by gender, user reviews, and a live competition. 

The project‚Äôs aim is to create a responsive and visually appealing online store that seamlessly guides users from browsing to checkout, with secure payment processing through Stripe. The store‚Äôs design and branding align with KVRN‚Äôs core identity: bold aesthetics, quality, and simplicity. This project also includes a unique competition feature where users can submit graphic designs, with winning designs featured on apparel items and royalties awarded to creators (this is a mockup, there is no royalties to be awarded).

KVRN Apparel was developed with attention to both business and technical goals, ensuring that users have a smooth, engaging experience across devices while meeting essential requirements for scalability, maintainability, and e-commerce best practices.

The primary objectives for **KVRN Apparel**- are:

1. **User-Centric Shopping Experience:**- Provide an intuitive, seamless shopping experience with essential features like Wishlist, product reviews, and personalized user profiles. 

2. **Visual Appeal and Brand Consistency:**- Ensure a bold, sleek aesthetic that aligns with KVRN's brand identity, resonating with modern consumers and differentiating the brand in the e-commerce space.

3. **Responsive Design:**- Develop a fully responsive site that delivers a smooth browsing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

4. **Secure and Efficient Checkout:**- Integrate Stripe for secure payments and customized delivery options, including multi-currency support for flexibility with international buyers.

5. **Community Engagement:**- Introduce a user-driven competition feature allowing users to submit graphic designs for apparel, fostering engagement and brand loyalty. Creators of selected designs receive royalties.

6. **Scalability and Maintainability:**- Build a robust, scalable application that adheres to best practices in code quality, SEO, and security, preparing the store for future growth.

## Target Audience

**KVRN Apparel**- is designed for style-conscious individuals looking for unique, high-quality apparel that combines bold design with a sleek, modern aesthetic. The target audience includes:

1. **Young Adults (Ages 18-35):**- Primarily targeting a demographic interested in contemporary fashion, self-expression, and unique designs that stand out.

2. **Creative Individuals:**- People with an interest in art and design, especially those who might participate in KVRN‚Äôs design submission competition to have their artwork featured on apparel.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏èBack to top](<#index>)

## Problem Being Solved

**KVRN Apparel**- addresses several key challenges in the online apparel shopping space, aiming to enhance user experience, brand loyalty, and operational efficiency. The problems being solved include:

1. **Streamlining the Shopping Experience:**- Many online stores lack intuitive navigation and product filtering, which can frustrate users. KVRN tackles this by offering responsive product filtering by gender and price, a Wishlist feature for favorites, and an organized catalog for quick product discovery.

2. **Enhancing Post-Purchase Engagement:**- Traditional e-commerce stores often lack effective ways for users to interact with their orders post-purchase. KVRN‚Äôs per-item rating system within orders encourages users to provide feedback, helping improve the shopping experience while gathering valuable product insights. The rating is managed through a convenient Bootstrap modal that can be updated, while automatically disabling ratings for products that have been removed from the store. This ensures a seamless user experience and data accuracy.

3. **Building Community and Brand Loyalty:**- By enabling users to submit their own designs in a competition format, KVRN fosters community involvement and deepens brand loyalty. Competition entries are managed dynamically, allowing users to update submissions and engage with KVRN‚Äôs brand in a creative way, with the added incentive of royalties for winning entries.

Through these solutions, KVRN Apparel addresses both common e-commerce pain points and unique challenges related to community engagement, encouraging a lasting connection with users.

### Risks and Mitigation Strategies

While KVRN Apparel has strong growth potential, several risks have been identified. Below are key risks along with mitigation strategies to address them:

  - **Mitigation**: Differentiate KVRN by focusing on unique, high-quality designs, maintaining a strong brand identity, and leveraging user-generated content and influencer partnerships.

- **Social Media Account Suspensions**: Past account suspensions on Facebook and Instagram pose a risk to ongoing marketing efforts.  
  - **Mitigation**: Build an email subscriber list and explore alternative platforms like TikTok and Pinterest to diversify KVRN's online presence. Maintain regular backups of marketing assets and customer contact information.

- **Production Delays and Quality Control**: Delays in manufacturing or issues with product quality could harm customer satisfaction.  
  - **Mitigation**: Work with reliable suppliers, establish quality control protocols, and communicate transparently with customers regarding any delays. 

- **Economic Downturn or Reduced Consumer Spending**: Shifts in the economy could impact customer purchasing behavior, reducing discretionary spending on apparel.  
  - **Mitigation**: Offer occasional discounts and flexible payment options (e.g., buy-now-pay-later), and diversify product lines to include budget-friendly options without compromising quality.

By proactively addressing these risks, KVRN Apparel aims to establish a resilient and adaptable business model capable of sustaining growth in a dynamic market environment.

### B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Strategy

KVRN Apparel's primary approach is rooted in a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, focused on directly reaching individual customers through digital channels and building long-term relationships based on trust, quality, and engagement. The B2C model allows KVRN to control the customer experience from discovery to purchase, enabling the brand to respond quickly to market trends and customer feedback.

#### Key Elements of the B2C Strategy

1. **Direct-to-Consumer Sales Platform**: 
   - The KVRN website serves as the central hub for all product sales, giving the brand complete control over the user experience, product presentation, and pricing strategies.
   - By selling directly to customers, KVRN eliminates intermediaries, allowing for competitive pricing while maintaining high profit margins.

2. **Personalized Marketing**:
   - **Social Media Engagement**: The brand's Instagram and Facebook pages provide direct, ongoing engagement with customers, showcasing product launches, seasonal collections, and design submissions. By maintaining a strong presence on these platforms, KVRN builds brand recognition and loyalty.
   - **Email Campaigns**: Targeted email marketing campaigns, including personalized recommendations, exclusive discounts, and early access to limited-edition items, drive repeat purchases and strengthen customer relationships.
   - **Retargeting Ads**: Retargeting campaigns on social media and Google Ads help bring back site visitors, increasing the chance of conversion by targeting users who have previously shown interest in KVRN products.

3. **Customer-Centric Approach**:
   - **Design Submission Competitions**: The design submission feature promotes customer involvement, inviting them to actively contribute to the brand‚Äôs identity. This strategy not only enhances engagement but also makes customers feel a unique connection to the brand.
   - **User-Generated Content (UGC)**: Encouraging customers to share photos of themselves wearing KVRN Apparel builds a community around the brand. UGC also serves as a powerful form of social proof, encouraging others to trust and engage with KVRN.
   - **Responsive Customer Service**: Prompt and helpful customer service fosters trust and loyalty, ensuring that any issues or inquiries are quickly addressed to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction.

4. **Loyalty and Retention Initiatives**:
   - **Wishlist and Save-for-Later Options**: By allowing users to save items they‚Äôre interested in, KVRN provides a personalized shopping experience that makes it easy for customers to return and purchase at a later date.
   - **Discount Codes and Promotions**: Exclusive discounts and special promotions are offered to loyal customers, enhancing brand loyalty and increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases.
   - **Customer Feedback Loop**: KVRN actively gathers feedback from customers to refine products and the shopping experience. This approach ensures that customers feel valued and heard, strengthening the brand-customer relationship.

5. **Community Building and Brand Loyalty**:
   - **Collaborations with Influencers**: Partnering with influencers and content creators who resonate with KVRN's target audience extends the brand‚Äôs reach and credibility. Influencers are provided with exclusive discount codes or free products to review, effectively promoting KVRN to a broader audience.
   - **Content Creation and Events**: Events such as Facebook or Instagram Lives, Q&A sessions, and virtual styling workshops keep the audience engaged and excited about the brand. Additionally, blog posts, tips, and fashion advice add value to the customer experience, making KVRN more than just an apparel brand.

#### B2C Advantages for KVRN Apparel

The B2C strategy gives KVRN control over its brand narrative and allows for a high level of personalization, responsiveness, and community engagement. By selling directly to consumers, KVRN maximizes customer relationships, maintains flexibility in pricing and promotions, and builds a loyal customer base that will contribute to long-term brand growth.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Plan

The development plan for KVRN Apparel follows an agile methodology, with a strong emphasis on research, iterative development, and a user-centric approach. Each phase of the project was structured to allow for flexible adjustments, ensuring that the product could evolve according to feedback and requirements.

### Research and Initial Decisions

In the early stages, extensive research was conducted to understand market trends, customer needs, and e-commerce best practices. These insights informed the foundational decisions for KVRN, guiding the selection of core features, design elements, and the user experience.

## Wireframes and ERD

The wireframes and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) were instrumental in the initial planning and design phases of the KVRN Apparel project. These wireframes provided visual guidance on page layouts and site navigation, ensuring a user-centered design approach. Below are the desktop and mobile wireframes for key site pages, as well as the ERD outlining the database structure.

#### Reflection on Wireframes and ERD

These wireframes and the ERD served as foundational tools in the early stages, guiding site navigation and the layout of critical elements like orders, the wishlist, and sidebar navigation. However, as the project evolved, certain aspects were adjusted or removed in response to agile development decisions and time constraints, focusing on an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first. Diverging from initial designs in favor of enhanced functionality and user experience proved beneficial, demonstrating the importance of flexibility and responsiveness as the project progressed.

### Agile Methodology

The KVRN Apparel project utilized agile methodology, focusing on delivering incremental value through short development cycles. This approach facilitated rapid iterations, enabled priority adjustments, and ensured that core functionalities were delivered within the timeline.

### Project Board

A [project board](documentation/agile-development/project-board.png) was used to organize tasks, track progress, and maintain a clear overview of the development lifecycle. The board was divided into key phases, providing a comprehensive view of tasks and their current status. This setup allowed for seamless flexibility and tracking, helping me stay aligned on priorities and timelines.

### Epics

The project was structured around key epics, which represented larger bodies of work aligned with primary features. As seen in the [epics image](documentation/agile-development/epics.png), each epic was broken down into user stories to guide the incremental development of the project. This hierarchical organization helped in managing complex features by dividing them into smaller, actionable tasks.

### MoSCoW

To prioritize features effectively, the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) was used. The [MoSCoW image](documentation/agile-development/labe&smoscow.png) illustrates how each feature was classified based on its importance to the MVP and the project‚Äôs timeline. This prioritization ensured that core functionalities were delivered first, with less essential features marked for future iterations as time allowed.

## üé® UX/UI Design Plan

The UX/UI Design Plan for KVRN Apparel is structured around the five planes of user experience design. Each plane represents a layer of the design process, building from strategic decisions to the final visual aesthetics. This structured approach ensures a seamless, user-friendly experience that aligns with business goals and user needs.

### The Strategy Plane

The Strategy Plane defines the project's overarching goals and user needs. For KVRN Apparel, the primary goal is to create an e-commerce platform that showcases custom apparel while offering an engaging, easy-to-navigate experience. Key user needs include quick product discovery, efficient checkout, and mobile-friendly design. User feedback from competitors‚Äô websites and market research helped shape the focus on accessibility, community engagement, and a smooth purchasing process.

### The Scope Plane

The Scope Plane outlines the features and content requirements necessary to achieve the project‚Äôs strategy. Core features include product browsing, filtering, checkout, user accounts, and wishlist functionality. Additional features, such as a design submission page and a profile area for tracking orders, support community engagement and personalization. Each feature was prioritized based on the MoSCoW method to ensure the MVP was delivered efficiently, with less essential features planned for future iterations.

### The Structure Plane

The Structure Plane defines the organization of information, focusing on user flows and navigation. KVRN Apparel‚Äôs structure is built for simplicity and intuitiveness, with a clear homepage leading to product categories and featured items. Each product page links directly to the cart or wishlist, allowing for easy checkout. Navigation menus are consistent across devices, and categories, search filters, and user account sections are structured to provide a smooth, predictable experience.

### The Skeleton Plane

The Skeleton Plane details the layout, including the placement of buttons, images, and text elements. Wireframes were created for each key page‚Äîhome, product, checkout, and profile pages‚Äîensuring a cohesive layout that supports user goals. CTA buttons (such as ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù) are prominently placed, with visual hierarchy guiding users through the purchasing process. The wireframes serve as blueprints, ensuring each page layout aligns with best practices for usability and mobile responsiveness.

### The Surface Plane

The Surface Plane focuses on the visual design, including colors, typography, and imagery. KVRN Apparel's aesthetic is sleek and modern, reflecting the brand‚Äôs identity through a minimalistic color palette, high-quality product images, and clean typography. Key colors include a blend of neutrals and accents, chosen for visual appeal and readability. Icons and images maintain a consistent look, enhancing the user experience without overwhelming the content. The final design prioritizes clarity and brand alignment, creating an attractive and engaging user interface.

## üóÉÔ∏è Custom Models Breakdown

The following models are custom-built to enhance KVRN Apparel's functionality, focusing on user engagement, product interaction, and order management. Each model has distinct fields and relationships that enable unique features such as user wishlists, design submissions, contact messaging, and product reviews within orders.

### 1. Wishlist Model

The `Wishlist` model allows users to save products they are interested in for future purchases. Key characteristics include:
- **Fields**:
  - `user`: Foreign key linking to Django‚Äôs `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, indicating the user who added the product to their wishlist.
  - `product`: Foreign key to the `Product` model, representing the specific item saved by the user.
  - `added_at`: Date and time when the product was added to the wishlist, automatically set when created.
- **Relationships**:
  - **One-to-Many** between `User` and `Wishlist`: A user can have multiple wishlist entries, but each entry is unique per product due to the unique constraint.
  - **One-to-Many** between `Product` and `Wishlist`: A single product can be added to wishlists by multiple users.
- **Unique Constraint**: Ensures that each user can only add a specific product once to their wishlist.

### 2. Contact Model

The `Contact` model enables users to send messages or inquiries through the contact page.
- **Fields**:
  - `name`: User‚Äôs name, captured as a string.
  - `email`: User‚Äôs email, validated as an email field.
  - `subject`: Brief subject line for the message.
  - `message`: The full message or inquiry text.
  - `submitted_at`: Timestamp for when the message was submitted.
- **Relationships**: 
  - This model is standalone with no foreign key relationships, making it a simple, self-contained model.
- **Purpose**: Captures and stores contact form submissions, aiding in customer communication and support.

### 3. UserDesignSubmission Model

The `UserDesignSubmission` model allows users to submit designs for potential use in apparel graphics, supporting engagement and creativity.
- **Fields**:
  - `user`: Foreign key linking to Django‚Äôs `User`, identifying the design creator.
  - `email`: User‚Äôs email address.
  - `title`: Title of the design submission.
  - `description`: Optional description of the design.
  - `image`: Image upload field for the design file.
  - `status`: Status of the submission, with choices between "submitted," "processing," and "finalized."
  - `created_at` and `updated_at`: Timestamps for creation and latest update.
- **Relationships**:
  - **One-to-Many** between `User` and `UserDesignSubmission`: Users can submit multiple designs.
- **Status Choices**: Enables tracking of each design‚Äôs review stage, allowing administrators to manage submissions effectively.

### 4. OrderReview Model

The `OrderReview` model allows users to review products they have purchased, providing feedback and ratings within individual orders.
- **Fields**:
  - `user`: Foreign key to `AUTH_USER_MODEL`, identifying the reviewer.
  - `product`: Foreign key to `Product`, representing the reviewed item.
  - `order`: Foreign key to the `Order` model, linking the review to the specific purchase.
  - `rating`: User‚Äôs rating for the product, from 1 to 5 stars.
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for when the review was created.
- **Relationships**:
  - **One-to-Many** between `User` and `OrderReview`: Each user can leave multiple reviews, one per product in each order.
  - **One-to-Many** between `Order` and `OrderReview`: Each order can have multiple reviews, corresponding to the products within it.
  - **One-to-Many** between `Product` and `OrderReview`: Each product can receive reviews from different users and orders.
- **Unique Constraint**: Ensures that a user can only review a specific product once per order, preventing duplicate reviews.

### Reflection on Model Changes

These custom models were essential in shaping KVRN Apparel's functionality and providing user-centered features. However, as the project evolved, certain navigation and layout elements, such as order and wishlist placement, as well as the initial idea of a sidebar navigation, were modified or removed due to time constraints and agile development choices. These models served as guides for feature implementation, though some divergence from initial designs in favor of improved functionality and user experience was both necessary and beneficial, helping the project achieve its MVP efficiently.
